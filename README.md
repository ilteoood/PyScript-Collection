# PyScript Collection

A collection of utility script.

### Info
The utilities that you will find in this collection are:

  - DirMaker.py: this will create the directory tree found inside a file called "list.txt", an example of the structure of this file can be found [here]. The structure will be created in the execution path of the script.
  - DirMapper.py: this will map the directories structure inside the "list.txt" file. The mapped directory is the same path of the execution path of the script.
  - FileDestroyer.py: this will destroy a specified file, with N overwrites of junk inside it.
  - FileMaker.py: this will create a series of N files, containing junk.
